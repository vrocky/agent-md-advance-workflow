# Implementation Strategy: generate_fixtures_manual

## Title
Strategy for Implementing a Simple, Planned-Structure Fixture Generator for Manual Testing (generate_fixtures_manual)

## Date Proposed
2025-07-13

## Objective
Provide a clear, step-by-step plan for implementing a fixture generator (named `generate_fixtures_manual`) that creates predictable, human-readable source and destination directory trees specifically for manual testing and inspection.

## Steps

1. **Design Directory Structure**
   - Define a predictable, human-readable directory tree for both source and destination (e.g., `source/folder1/file1.txt`, `dest/folder1/`).
   - Decide on default parameters (depth, width, files per folder) and allow user overrides.
   - Ensure the structure is easy to browse and verify manually.

2. **Script Setup**
   - Create a Python script (e.g., `scripts/generate_fixtures_manual.py`).
   - Use `argparse` to accept parameters for structure customization (e.g., number of folders, files, depth).
   - Add a clear option or mode for manual test fixture generation.

3. **Directory and File Creation**
   - Use `os` and `pathlib` to create directories and files.
   - Populate the source directory with the planned structure and a few duplicate files.
   - Optionally, pre-populate the destination directory with a subset of files for copy/skip testing.
   - Ensure all files and folders are named and organized for easy manual inspection.

4. **Documentation**
   - Add clear docstrings and usage instructions to the script, emphasizing manual test usage.
   - Reference the script in your manual test documentation.

5. **Manual Verification**
   - After generation, browse the directories to verify structure and contents are as expected for manual tests.
