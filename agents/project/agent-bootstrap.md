# Agent Bootstrap: project Directory Guide

Before any work in the `agents/project` directory, you must follow the context loading protocol in `project-context-loading.md`.

To begin working in the `agents/project` directory, start by reading `project-guildelines.md`.

All project overview, structure, coding conventions, and automation rules for this directory are fully described in `project-guildelines.md`.

Refer to that file for:
- Project overview and directory structure
- Coding, file operation, and automation conventions
- Testing, linting, and CI requirements
- Scripts and Taskfile usage

_This file serves only as a pointer. For all details, see `project-guildelines.md` in this directory._

For mandatory project context loading steps, see `project-context-loading.md` in this directory.
