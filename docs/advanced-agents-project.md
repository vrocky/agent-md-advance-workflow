# Advanced AGENTS Project Template

This document describes how to structure a GitHub repository for advanced AI agents using the `AGENTS.md` technique showcased in this repository.

## Overview
1. **Top-Level `AGENTS.md`** — Provides an index to project and rules documentation, plus core bootstrap steps.
2. **`agents/` Directory** — Houses all project rules, protocols, and workflow files. Organize subdirectories for `project`, `rules`, and `workflow` as demonstrated here.
3. **Workflow Documentation** — Maintain requirement proposals, strategies, user stories, and tasks within `agents/workflow`. Follow the archival protocol to keep active files clean and move completed items to dated folders.
4. **Protocol Compliance** — Every agent must load requirements and inspect the directory structure on resume, as described in the project context documents.

## Getting Started
- Clone this repository as a starting point or replicate the directory structure in your own project.
- Update the documents under `agents/` to match your specific rules and requirements.
- Keep `AGENTS.md` up to date as the single entry point for collaborators.

By documenting operational rules directly in the repository, teams and agents can coordinate effectively and maintain an auditable history of all decisions and processes.
